# This repo is created to hold my solution to Xwerx Technical Test
# Requirements:
## Use modern JavaScript Framework
## Using HTML / CSS / JSON / Ajax call to create chart and grid components
## Handle Cross-Browser Compatibility

# I have Chosen to use AngularJS and SCSS as my primary technologies with Gulp as a preprocessor

# Instructions on how to set up local repo:
## Clone repo to your machine
## Open command line, navigate to project folder and run "npm install && bower install"
#### This will install all dependencies for preprocessor and FontAwesome
## After npm and bower are finished run "gulp"
## Your local repo is installed and ready to use

## Gulp tasks that I have used within this project are tasks that I am using on most of my projects
## Those tasks allow me to have specific CSS and/or JS per template

## v1.0
# Technical test finished
